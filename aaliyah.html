Bio:

I am a 17 year-old student FROM DC and I attend Suitland High School involved in the IBCP program.
The International Baccalaureate Career-related Program has so many opportunities and allows students to excel academically.
 I am also a proud member and Teen President of Jack and Jill of America Inc.- Prince George's County Chapter, where we work to better our communities through service.
  I plan to attend college next year and law school shortly after.
